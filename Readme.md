NOMAD
=====

#### Synopsis
Nomad is .NET Open Modular Application Development Framework designed to ease burden of creating WPF enabled that make heavy use of independent modules.

#### Description
Architecture and design is descibed in pdf file (in Polish), named "architecture-and-design.pdf". Several chapters would be translated to English in future.

#### Installation and use
Bunch of examples may be found within solution in samples project. We find it quite useful, but we are aware that there are features that should be added to this product at some moment of time. Feel free to contribute, or at least create a ticket with requirements request.
You can download binaries from our continuous integration server, which is not 100% available. In case, if you fail accessing it, you may simply run "runBuild.bat" and skip information about build errors (these are tests errors).
Binaries would be located in D:\projekty\studia\studia-inz\Release\Nomad\bin.

#### Development
If you would like to contribute in development, make sure to install Nomad Fake CA, what is obligatory to pass all of the unit tests. Follow instructions written in Research/Certificates/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS
